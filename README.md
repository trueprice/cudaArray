libcua (Library for CUDA Arrays) is a header-only library that simplifies
creation, access, and modification for 2D and 3D CUDA array-type objects,
including linear-memory arrays, texture objects, and surface objects.

Contributions are welcome for this project! To name a few TODO items, texture
mipmapping and examples could both be added.
